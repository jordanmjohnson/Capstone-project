What are the major entities for your objects? Who needs to access them?

A) User data (weight, height, gender), devices connected to the game, and progress reports for both game progress and real life goal progress for the user.

B) The user and any connected devices should be able to access these entities
		
		
What assumptions are you making about your entities? Clarify them.

A) The entities being made will be used in collaboration with other devices and techniques to ensure the user gets the most out of what is being offered as well as
		
		
		
What functionality should each entity have?

A) Each entity should be able to provide the user with more details how they can reach their current goal whether it be phyiscal, economical, or mental as well as allowing the user to have fun doing so.
		
		
How do the entities need to be connected? 

A) Entities should be linked in a way that would allow the user to easily traverse the app while understanding the steps they need to take in order to reach there goals as well as view the ways others have achieved goals similar to theirs.
		
		
		
Can you identify where you use Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, and Encapsulation in your designs?

A) In terms of abstraction, we would enable users to locate local gyms to work at as well as introduce an invitation system that would allow users to pair up with strangers or friends if the gym allows for guest gym users.

B) The bmi calculator can be paired with other functions in the app such as a calories burned tracker or bmi goal tracker, both of which would use the original weight presented in the bmi calculator and vice versa to determine how many calories are burnt per action and how many times in a designated amount of time that person need to do it in in order to reach their goal.

C) User stats could be shared with friends and vice versa as well as common goals between the two as well as a personal, local, and global leaderboard that would help praise those who have done the most to reach their goals and give them a virtual podium to describe what they have done to get where they are.

D) Personal data for users would be hidden from both us and the general public, this personal data include/might include things such as: address, email, phone number, password, friends linked through the app, and current and past locations.
		
		
		
How will you apply KISS and DRY to your design?

A) We will refrain from creating multiple classes/objects for things that can be used as whole object such as pairng the bmi calculator with the calories burned tracker to help users better understand what they need to do in order to reach their goal weight.
